# Game

The purpose of this repository is to build a simple game on Base. 
I am currently practicing deploying smart contracts on the Sepholia Testnet with [Testnet Choice](https://sepolia.basescan.org/token/0x72b423d98d98d509e66e9c565873c3e63ee4c7ab).

Smart Contract Token Address: 0x72b423d98d98d509e66e9c565873c3e63ee4c7ab

# MVP Functional Requirements
1. The smart contract must be fundable via metamask transfer with ETH for gas and Choice for the game.
2. The smart contract must recieve exactly 1 Choice via a Metamask transfer.
3. The smart contract must return exactly 2 Choice to the sender.
